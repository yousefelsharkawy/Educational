He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific <b>Mah\u0101tm\u0101</b> (from Sanskrit\u00a0'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.\n</p><p>Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London, and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.\n</p><p>Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving <i>swaraj</i> or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short <i>dhoti</i> woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\n</p><p>Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when he was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. \n</p><p>Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India.

He inspired movements for [[Civil rights movements|civil rights]] and freedom across the world. The honorific '''Mah\u0101tm\u0101''' ({{ety|sa||great-souled, venerable}}), first applied to him in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] in 1914, is now used throughout the world.\n\nBorn and raised in a [[Hindu]] family in coastal [[Gujarat]], Gandhi trained in the law at the [[Inner Temple]] in London, and was [[called to the bar]] in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.\n\nAssuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending [[untouchability]], and, above all, achieving ''[[swaraj]]'' or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short ''[[dhoti]]'' woven with [[Charkha (spinning wheel)|hand-spun]] yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a [[Sabarmati Ashram|self-sufficient residential community]], to eat simple food, and undertake [[List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi|long fasts]] as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed [[Salt tax#Impacted regions|salt tax]] with the {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Salt March|Dandi Salt March]] in 1930 and in calling for the British to [[Quit India Movement|quit India]] in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\n\nGandhi's vision of an independent India based on [[religious pluralism]] was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within [[British India]]. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] into two [[dominion]]s, a Hindu-majority [[Dominion of India|India]] and a Muslim-majority [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and [[Sikh]]s made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]]. Abstaining from the [[Independence Day (India)|official celebration of independence]], Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several [[hunger strike]]s to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when he was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was [[Nathuram Godse]], a militant [[Hindu nationalist]] from [[Pune]], western India, who [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated Gandhi]] by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. \n\nGandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as [[Gandhi Jayanti]], a [[Public holidays in India|national holiday]], and worldwide as the [[International Day of Non-Violence|International Day of Nonviolence]]. Gandhi is considered to be the [[Father of the Nation]] in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called ''Bapu'' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] endearment for \"father\", roughly \"papa\",<ref name=\"McAllister1982-lead\">{{cite book |last=McAllister |first=Pam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vt8hAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA194 |title=Reweaving the Web of Life: Feminism and Nonviolence |publisher=New Society Publishers |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-86571-017-7 |page=194 |accessdate=31 August 2013}} Quote: \"With love, Yours, Bapu (You closed with the term of endearment used by your close friends, the term you used with all the movement leaders, roughly meaning 'Papa.{{'\"}} Another letter written in 1940 shows similar tenderness and caring.</ref> \"daddy\"<ref name=\"Eck2003-lead\">{{cite book |last=Eck |first=Diana L. |author-link=Diana Eck |title=Encountering God: A Spiritual Journey from Bozeman to Banaras |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpR0AmKLeY4C&pg=PA210 |publisher=Beacon Press |year=2003 |page=210 |access-date=31 August 2013 |isbn=978-0-8070-7301-8}} Quote: \"...&nbsp;his niece Manu, who, like others called this immortal Gandhi 'Bapu,' meaning not 'father,' but the familiar, 'daddy.{{'\"}} (p. 210)</ref>).<!--Do NOT add citations to the lead, except for material likely to be challenged, per [[MOS:LEADCITE]] ([[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations)]].

Upon arrival, he stayed with the local Modh Bania community whose elders warned him that England would tempt him to compromise his religion, and eat and drink in Western ways. Despite Gandhi informing them of his promise to his mother and her blessings, he was excommunicated from his caste. Gandhi ignored this, and on 4 September, he sailed from Bombay to London, with his brother seeing him off.<ref name=\"autogenerated33\" /><ref name=\"Turban\" /> Gandhi attended [[University College, London]], where he took classes in English literature with [[Henry Morley]] in 1888\u20131889.<ref>{{cite news |last=Swapnajit Mitra |date=12 October 2014 |title=My Experiment with Truth |work=[[India Currents]] |url=https://indiacurrents.com/my-experiment-with-truth/}}</ref>\n\nHe also enrolled at the [[City Law School|Inns of Court School of Law]] in [[Inner Temple]] with the intention of becoming a [[barrister]].<ref name=\"B.

In 1889, a [[London dock strike, 1889|bitter trade dispute]] broke out in London, with dockers striking for better pay and conditions, and seamen, shipbuilders, factory girls and other joining the strike in solidarity. The strikers were successful, in part due to the mediation of [[Henry Edward Manning|Cardinal Manning]], leading Gandhi and an Indian friend to make a point of visiting the cardinal and thanking him for his work.<ref>{{cite web |title=Narayan Hemchandra &#124; Gandhi Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments with Truth |url=https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap22.htm |access-date=20 February 2023 |website=www.mkgandhi.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Vegetarianism and committee work ===\nGandhi's time in London was influenced by the vow he had made to his mother. He tried to adopt \"English\" customs, including taking dancing lessons. However, he did not appreciate the bland vegetarian food offered by his landlady and was frequently hungry until he found one of London's few vegetarian restaurants. Influenced by [[Henry Stephens Salt|Henry Salt's]] writing, he joined the [[Vegetarian Society|London Vegetarian Society]], and was elected to its executive committee<ref name=\"Brown1991\">[[#Brown1991|Brown (1991)]].</ref> under the aegis of its president and benefactor [[Arnold Hills]]. An achievement while on the committee was the establishment of a [[Bayswater]] chapter.<ref name=\"Tendulkar1951\" /> Some of the vegetarians he met were members of the [[Theosophical Society]], which had been founded in 1875 to further universal brotherhood, and which was devoted to the study of [[Buddhist]] and [[Hindu]] literature. They encouraged Gandhi to join them in reading the [[Bhagavad Gita]] both in translation as well as in the original.<ref name=\"Brown1991\" />\n\nGandhi had a friendly and productive relationship with Hills, but the two men took a different view on the continued LVS membership of fellow committee member [[Thomas Allinson]]. Their disagreement is the first known example of Gandhi challenging authority, despite his shyness and temperamental disinclination towards confrontation.\n\nAllinson had been promoting [[Birth control#Birth control movement|newly available birth control methods]], but Hills disapproved of these, believing they undermined public morality. He believed [[History of vegetarianism#19th century|vegetarianism to be a moral movement]] and that Allinson should therefore no longer remain a member of the LVS. Gandhi shared Hills' views on the dangers of birth control, but defended Allinson's right to differ.<ref name=\"shyness\">{{Cite web |date=1927 |title=Shyness my shield |url=https://www.mkgandhi.org/autobio/chap18.htm |website=Autobiography}}</ref> It would have been hard for Gandhi to challenge Hills; Hills was 12 years his senior and unlike Gandhi, highly eloquent. He bankrolled the LVS and was a [[captain of industry]] with his [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] company employing more than 6,000 people in the [[East End of London]]. He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club [[West Ham United]]. In his 1927 ''An Autobiography, Vol. I'', Gandhi wrote:\n\n{{blockquote| The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity. But I thought it was quite improper to exclude a man from a vegetarian society simply because he refused to regard puritan morals as one of the objects of the society<ref name=\"shyness\" />}}\n\nA motion to remove Allinson was raised, and was debated and voted on by the committee. Gandhi's shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. He wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented him from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson excluded. There were no hard feelings, with Hills proposing the toast at the LVS farewell dinner in honour of Gandhi's return to India.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Vegetarian Union \u2013 Mohandas K.

Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, and the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a \"parasite\", \"semi-barbarous\", \"canker\", \"squalid coolie\", \"yellow man\", and other epithets.

He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and community organiser.\n\nGandhi joined the [[Indian National Congress]] and was introduced to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party best known for his restraint and moderation, and his insistence on working inside the system.

The British did not recognise the declaration but negotiations ensued, with the Congress taking a role in provincial government in the late 1930s. Gandhi and the Congress withdrew their support of the Raj when the Viceroy declared war on Germany in September 1939 without consultation.

The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (''[[Indigofera]]'' sp.), a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price.

For five months, the administration refused, but by the end of May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended.

Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using 'love' to deal with the 'hate' of the British government.<ref name=\"Wolpert2002p99\" /> Gandhi demanded that the Indian people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gandhi |first=Mohandas Karamchand |title=An Autobiography or The Story of My Experiments With Truth |title-link=The Story of My Experiments with Truth |publisher=Navajivan Publishing House |year=1940 |isbn=0-8070-5909-9 |edition=2 |location=Ahmedabad |page=[https://archive.org/details/autobiographyst00gand/page/82 82]}} Also available at [[s:An Autobiography or The Story of my Experiments with Truth|Wikisource]].</ref>\n\nThe massacre and Gandhi's non-violent response to it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott.<ref name=\"Wolpert2002p99\" /> The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief that Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to ''swaraj'' and political independence for India.<ref name=\"Chakrabarty2008\">{{Cite book |last=Chakrabarty |first=Bidyut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzQHZ178C24C&pg=PA154 |title=Indian Politics and Society since Independence: events, processes and ideology |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-415-40868-4 |page=154 |access-date=4 April 2012}}</ref> In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress.<ref name=\"ghosep161\" /> He reorganised the Congress.

Linked to this was his advocacy that ''[[khadi]]'' (homespun cloth) be worn by all Indians instead of British-made textiles. Gandhi exhorted Indian men and women, rich or poor, to spend time each day spinning ''khadi'' in support of the independence movement.<ref>[[#Desai|Desai]], p. 89.</ref> In addition to boycotting British products, Gandhi urged the people to boycott British institutions and law courts, to resign from government employment, and to forsake [[British honours system|British titles and honours]]. Gandhi thus began his journey aimed at crippling the British India government economically, politically and administratively.<ref name=\"Shashi1996\">[[#Shashi|Shashi]], p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe appeal of \"Non-cooperation\" grew, its social popularity drew participation from all strata of Indian society. Gandhi was arrested on 10 March 1922, tried for sedition, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He began his sentence on 18 March 1922. With Gandhi isolated in prison, the Indian National Congress split into two factions, one led by [[Chitta Ranjan Das]] and [[Motilal Nehru]] favouring party participation in the legislatures, and the other led by [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]] and [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], opposing this move.<ref>[[#Desai|Desai]], p. 131.</ref> Furthermore, co-operation among Hindus and Muslims ended as Khilafat movement collapsed with the rise of Atat\u00fcrk in Turkey.

Gandhi led Congress in a celebration on 26 January 1930 of [[Independence Day (India)|India's Independence Day]] in Lahore. This day was commemorated by almost every other Indian organisation. Gandhi then launched a new Satyagraha against the British salt tax in March 1930. Gandhi sent an ultimatum in the form of a letter personally addressed to Lord Irwin, the viceroy of India, on 2 March. Gandhi condemned British rule in the letter, describing it as \"a curse\" that \"has impoverished the dumb millions by a system of progressive exploitation and by a ruinously expensive military and civil administration...It has reduced us politically to serfdom.\" Gandhi also mentioned in the letter that the viceroy received a salary \"over five thousand times India's average income.\" In the letter, Gandhi also stressed his continued adherence to non-violent forms of protest.<ref>{{Cite book |last=S R Bakshi |title=Gandhi and Gandhi and the Mass Movement |publisher=New Delhi |year=1988 |pages=133\u201334}}</ref>\n\nThis was highlighted by the Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April, where, together with 78 volunteers, he marched {{convert|388|km|mi}} from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way. Thousands of Indians joined him in Dandi. On 5 May he was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned. The protest at Dharasana salt works on 21 May went ahead without him see. A horrified American journalist, [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]], described the British response thus:\n\n{{blockquote|In complete silence the Gandhi men drew up and halted a hundred yards from the stockade. A picked column advanced from the crowd, waded the ditches and approached the barbed wire stockade... at a word of command, scores of native policemen rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads with their steel-shot lathis [long bamboo sticks]. Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off blows. They went down like ninepins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whack of the clubs on unprotected skulls...

The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.<ref name=\"Murali1985\" />\n\nAccording to Dennis Dalton, it was Gandhi's ideas that were responsible for his wide following. Gandhi criticised Western civilisation as one driven by \"brute force and immorality\", contrasting it with his categorisation of Indian civilisation as one driven by \"soul force and morality\".<ref name=\"dennis20\" /> Gandhi captured the imagination of the people of his heritage with his ideas about winning \"hate with love\". These ideas are evidenced in his pamphlets from the 1890s, in South Africa, where too he was popular among the Indian [[Indian indenture system|indentured workers]]. After he returned to India, people flocked to him because he reflected their values.<ref name=\"dennis20\" />\n\n[[File:Gandhi first visit to Odisha.jpg|thumb| Gandhi's first visit to [[Odisha]] in 1921, a general meeting held at the riverbed of Kathajodi]]\n\nGandhi also campaigned hard going from one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another.

Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]], decided to negotiate with Gandhi. The [[Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact]] was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all [[political prisoner]]s, in return for the suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.<ref name=\"Herman2008\">{{Cite book |last=Herman |first=Arthur |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tquxD6dk914C&pg=PA375 |title=Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry that Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age |date=29 April 2008 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-553-90504-5 |pages=375\u2013377}}</ref>\n\nIn Britain, [[Winston Churchill]], a prominent Conservative politician who was then out of office but later became its prime minister, became a vigorous and articulate critic of Gandhi and opponent of his long-term plans.

He called Gandhi as the one who was \"seditious in aim\" whose evil genius and multiform menace was attacking the British empire. Churchill called him a dictator, a \"Hindu [[Mussolini]]\", fomenting a race war, trying to replace the Raj with [[Brahmin]] cronies, playing on the ignorance of Indian masses, all for selfish gain.<ref name=\"Herman2008p378\" /> Churchill attempted to isolate Gandhi, and his criticism of Gandhi was widely covered by European and American press.

He inspired movements for [[Civil rights movements|civil rights]] and freedom across the world. The honorific '''Mah\u0101tm\u0101''' (<template><title>ety</title><part><name index=\"1\"/><value>sa</value></part><part><name index=\"2\"/><value/></part><part><name index=\"3\"/><value>great-souled, venerable</value></part></template>), first applied to him in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] in 1914, is now used throughout the world.\n\nBorn and raised in a [[Hindu]] family in coastal [[Gujarat]], Gandhi trained in the law at the [[Inner Temple]] in London, and was [[called to the bar]] in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.\n\nAssuming leadership of the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending [[untouchability]], and, above all, achieving ''[[swaraj]]'' or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short ''[[dhoti]]'' woven with [[Charkha (spinning wheel)|hand-spun]] yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a [[Sabarmati Ashram|self-sufficient residential community]], to eat simple food, and undertake [[List of fasts undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi|long fasts]] as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed [[Salt tax#Impacted regions|salt tax]] with the <template><title>convert</title><part><name index=\"1\"/><value>400</value></part><part><name index=\"2\"/><value>km</value></part><part><name index=\"3\"/><value>mi</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template> [[Salt March|Dandi Salt March]] in 1930 and in calling for the British to [[Quit India Movement|quit India]] in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\n\nGandhi's vision of an independent India based on [[religious pluralism]] was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within [[British India]]. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] into two [[dominion]]s, a Hindu-majority [[Dominion of India|India]] and a Muslim-majority [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and [[Sikh]]s made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]]. Abstaining from the [[Independence Day (India)|official celebration of independence]], Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several [[hunger strike]]s to stop the religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948, when he was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defense of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was [[Nathuram Godse]], a militant [[Hindu nationalist]] from [[Pune]], western India, who [[Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassinated Gandhi]] by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948. \n\nGandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as [[Gandhi Jayanti]], a [[Public holidays in India|national holiday]], and worldwide as the [[International Day of Non-Violence|International Day of Nonviolence]]. Gandhi is considered to be the [[Father of the Nation]] in post-colonial India.

He bankrolled the LVS and was a [[captain of industry]] with his [[Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company|Thames Ironworks]] company employing more than 6,000 people in the [[East End of London]]. He was also a highly accomplished sportsman who later founded the football club [[West Ham United]]. In his 1927 ''An Autobiography, Vol. I'', Gandhi wrote:\n\n<template lineStart=\"1\"><title>blockquote</title><part><name index=\"1\"/><value> The question deeply interested me...I had a high regard for Mr. Hills and his generosity.

Gandhi's shyness was an obstacle to his defence of Allinson at the committee meeting. He wrote his views down on paper but shyness prevented him from reading out his arguments, so Hills, the President, asked another committee member to read them out for him. Although some other members of the committee agreed with Gandhi, the vote was lost and Allinson excluded.

The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against largely Anglo-Indian plantation owners who were backed by the local administration. The peasants were forced to grow indigo (''[[Indigofera]]'' sp.), a cash crop for [[Indigo dye]] whose demand had been declining over two decades, and were forced to sell their crops to the planters at a fixed price. Unhappy with this, the peasantry appealed to Gandhi at his [[ashram]] in Ahmedabad.

According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London for discussions and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, [[Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon|Lord Willingdon]], took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement.
